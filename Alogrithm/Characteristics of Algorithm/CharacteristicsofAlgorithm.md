The characteristics of an algorithm define what makes a procedure an algorithm. A valid algorithm should have the following properties:

1️⃣ Input
An algorithm must take zero or more inputs.
Inputs provide data for processing.
Example: A sorting algorithm takes an array as input.
2️⃣ Output
It must produce at least one output.
The output is the result of the algorithm.
Example: A sorting algorithm returns a sorted array.
3️⃣ Definiteness (Unambiguity)
Each step should be clearly defined and unambiguous.
There should be no confusion about what needs to be done.
Example: "Increase the counter by 1" is clear, while "Increase the counter somehow" is ambiguous.
4️⃣ Finiteness
The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
It should not run indefinitely.
Example: A loop should have a stopping condition.
5️⃣ Effectiveness
Each step should be simple enough to be executed within a reasonable time using basic operations.
Example: Mathematical operations like addition and comparison should be easily computable.
6️⃣ Generality
The algorithm should work for all valid inputs (not just specific cases).
Example: A sorting algorithm should work for any array of numbers, not just a fixed set.
